## the next best thing for finding car meets
Created by car enthusiasts, for car enthusiasts. The aim of the passion project is to connect the enthusiast with the meet. 

The current system is hoping to find something semi-active on some form of social media, but we think that's backwards. 
Why should *you* be seeking out meets and not the other way around? That's the gap that we're trying to bridge. 
Current options are out-dated (*cough* *cough* socalcarculture), abandoned (carmeets.app), or don't include the little guys (like our very own Fullerton Motor Group).
We want to facilitate the interaction between host and enthusiast from the most general, prestigious types of meets to your local parking garage meets.
